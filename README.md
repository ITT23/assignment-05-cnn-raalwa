## 03-media-control

Start the media_control.py script and place the ArUco marker board in front of the webcam.

Perform the following gestures in front of the board to control your media:

- **Stop**: Stops/Resumes the media track
- **Thumbs-up**: Increases volume
- **Thumbs-down**: Decreases volume

It should work just fine... (if the prediction wasn't horrific :( )
